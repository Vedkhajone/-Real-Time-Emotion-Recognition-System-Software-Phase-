# 🤖 Real-Time Emotion Recognition System (Software Phase)

This project detects human emotions in real-time using a webcam feed. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a facial expression dataset to classify emotions like **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprise**, etc., and displays them live using OpenCV.

Currently in **software simulation phase** — intended for future integration with intelligent robotics and embedded systems.
